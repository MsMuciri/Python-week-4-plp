#File Handling Challenge & Error Handling Lab
#Overview
This project focuses on file management and error handling in Python. You will learn how to:

#Read a file, modify its contents, and write a modified version to a new file.
Handle file errors gracefully by asking the user for a filename and managing potential issues such as the file not existing or being unreadable.

#File Read & Write Challenge 🖋️

Opens and read an existing file.
Modify the content (for example, converting it to uppercase).
Write the modified content to a new file.

#Error Handling Lab 🧪

Prompt the user to enter a filename.
Use error handling to manage issues like a missing file or other IO errors.
Provide feedback if the file cannot be opened or read.
