File Handling Challenge & Error Handling Lab
Overview
This project focuses on file management and error handling in Python. You will learn how to:

Read a file, modify its contents, and write a modified version to a new file.
Handle file errors gracefully by asking the user for a filename and managing potential issues such as the file not existing or being unreadable.
File Read & Write Challenge üñãÔ∏è
In this challenge, you will create a program that:

Opens and reads an existing file.
Modifies the content (for example, converting it to uppercase).
Writes the modified content to a new file.
Example:
The program reads a file, converts its content to uppercase, and writes the result to a new file.

Error Handling Lab üß™
In this lab, you will:

Prompt the user to enter a filename.
Use error handling to manage issues like a missing file or other IO errors.
Provide feedback if the file cannot be opened or read.
